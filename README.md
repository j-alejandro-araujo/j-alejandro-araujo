# Greetings! üëã

## üí¨ About me
As a first-generation Latinx immigrant, I've always believed in the power of hard work and determination. With a strong background in finance and accounting, I decided to diversify my skill tree by mastering software engineering. 

Why? Two reasons, the first is to empower my community. Growing up in an immigrant household, software engineering seemed like an impossible dream. I remember watching The Matrix as a kid and asking everyone I knew what coding was? The answer, "I don't know, computer stuff?". Unfortunately, there were no resources available for us to learn about technology. I'd like to change that by sharing my knowledge, experiences, and resources with my community and others who are interested, particularly those in marginalized communities. 

The second reason is pretty straightforward: I just love building things. I've always considered myself a naturally creative person. I thrive on exploring new ideas, finding alternative solutions, and problem-solving. Whether it's picking up a paintbrush to create art, designing bespoke financial reports, or coding a web application. I thrive on the process of bringing ideas to life, it fuels my drive to constantly learn and innovate.

This journey has allowed me to combine my passion for technology, art, and finance. I aim to leverage my diverse experiences and technical skills to make a positive impact in my community. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to bring about positive change!
